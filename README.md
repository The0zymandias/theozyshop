# theozyshop

A small unistore that I made to make moving larger files easier without an SD card. 
TheOzyShopMedia is the only one that is maintained.
It holds movies, an amine, a few albums I like, and more. If you want me to add something, put it on internet archive or Dropbox and put the link in issues, and I will add it. The lack of icons is intentional.
